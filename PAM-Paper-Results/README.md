## Subdirectory: CTI

This directory contains the core results of the CTI paper (Sec. 5.1): the CTI values for each Autonomous System in each country.
Files are named as CC.csv, with CC being the 2-letter country code.
The first column is the AS Number - ASName, and the second column is the CTI value for that AS.

### Origin

We also publish the number of addresses originated by each AS in each country. Files are named as <CC>.csv, with <CC> being the 2-letter country code.
The columns are explained in the README.md file in the Origin subdirectory.

## Subdirectory: TransitDominance

We release our findings from the transit-dominance analysis in the CTI paper.
  
From Sec. 6.3: Country-level transit fractions T(C) for countries in our sample (column 5, transit_w_scaled):
