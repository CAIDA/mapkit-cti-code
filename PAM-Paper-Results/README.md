## Subdirectory: CTI

This directory contains the core results of the CTI paper (Sec. 5.1): the CTI values for each Autonomous System in each country.

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/tree/master/PAM-Paper-Results/CTI/CC.csv
- Files are named as CC.csv, with CC being the 2-letter country code.
- The first column is the AS Number - ASName, and the second column is the CTI value for that AS.

### Origin

We also publish the number of addresses originated by each AS in each country. 

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/tree/master/PAM-Paper-Results/CTI/origin/CC.csv
- Files are named as CC.csv, with CC being the 2-letter country code.
- The columns are explained in the README.md file in the Origin subdirectory.

## Subdirectory: TransitDominance

We release our findings from the transit-dominance analysis in the CTI paper.
  
From Sec. 6.3: Country-level transit fractions T(C) for countries in our sample

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/blob/master/PAM-Paper-Results/TransitDominance/country.transit.summary.202003.csv 
- T(C) is in column 5, transit_w_scaled
  
From Sec. 6.1: percentage of a country's address space originated by candidate ASes 

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/blob/master/PAM-Paper-Results/TransitDominance/individual_as_country_qualifier_20200301.csv
- percentage of a country's address space originated by candidate ASes is in column 3, country_perc_addresses
  
## Subdirectory: Misc
  
From Sec. 9.1: Comparison with Hegemony

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/blob/master/PAM-Paper-Results/Misc/combined_joint_cti_hegemony.csv
- Data for all AS-Country pairs: ASN, CTI, Hegemony
  
From Sec. 5.2: Submarine cable operators

- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/blob/master/PAM-Paper-Results/Misc/LIST_SUBMARINE_CABLE_OPERATORS_AND_ASES.xlsx
- Data for each non-landlocked country
- Column headers: Country Code,	Country Name,	CTI Rank,	Top AS, Top AS CTI, Submarine Cable(s)
 
From Sec. 5.3: State-owned ASes
    
- https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code/blob/master/PAM-Paper-Results/Misc/state_owned_F_CTIn.csv
- Column 2 is CTIn, Column 3 is F(C), Column 4 is Directly Originated
